# Web Development Assignment

## Description

This is a small assignment which is based on a simple task:

* Create a rudimentary TODO web app.

The assignment code includes some boilerplate to get the candidate running.

The assignment should not have to last more than an hour, but could take longer, please spend more if you find it desirable.

The assignment can be completed at home or pair-programmed during the interview.

The follow-up discussion will be focused around the assignment code, any other unrelated questions will be provided in advance so that the candidate will not be put on the spot, this gives them time for consideration as they also would be given during normal working circumstances.

It is OK to review and discuss any reference solutions as well, as the interview is not supposed to be a "gotcha" moment, but a learning experience for both parts.

## Requirements

1. Clone the repository, create a new branch from main and name it `assignment/<your-name-here>`. Make the repository public.

2. Study this image. The task is to create a very simple TODO web app. The app should have an input field. When text is inputted and the Enter key is pressed, a sticky note should be generated with the inputted text inside. You may style it to your own taste, but you could also take inspiration from the image if you wish.

3. No backend or database code is necessary, only client code (JavaScript/Typescript, HTML and CSS).

4. Use at least two custom [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements) to build the app and then use those custom element/s in the DOM.

5. No JS or CSS library or framework can be used. 
(_Ex: React, Angular, Tailwind, SASS, Material Design_). Typescript is allowed.

6. Start from the existing code base and have fun! Feel free to add your own features if you like.

7. Commit, push the changes and open a PR towards the `main` branch and copy the link to the pull request and send it to the reviewer. Add some comments (for instance from step 4) to the PR if you so prefer.
